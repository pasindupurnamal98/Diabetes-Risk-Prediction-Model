# FDM_miniProject - Diabetes Risk Prediction Model

• Machine leaming algorithms and statistical methods applied to this historical data to predict diabetes at an early
stage.

• The dataset publicized by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based in the United States. This
dataset was found on Kaggle to predict which patients are at risk of diabetes using many features.

• Class imbalance was detected in the pre-processing steps and we fixed the dataset using Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)

• Using several alternative models, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation methods to select the most suitable
model to make predictions.
• the dassification models we used:
1. Naive Bayes
3. Logistic Regression models.
• After some evaluations (accuracy and f1 score) we have decided to go with the Naive Bayes model

• to host this application on the web we used the streamlit platform
this is the frontend that streamed by streamlet
